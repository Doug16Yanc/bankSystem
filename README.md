# Bank System Management Java 🤓💻☕

Public repository containing Java project for a financial institution management system.

## Description 📄📃

The banking control management system of this project was built using the Java programming language and the object-oriented paradigm with code modularization. 
There are three entities that represent human beings: the manager, the attendant (made up of three instances) and the customer, the latter can be of the natural or
legal type. The manager acts as a super administrator, having different levels of access and security privileges. Attendants act as intermediaries between customers 
and the manager, ensuring coherent management of the institution. Customers, of either type, can register with the institution, however the creation of an account 
(savings or checking) must be requested from an attendant who carries out the creation and other operations requested, such as account deactivation and total deletion
from the institution's database. The customer's income is informed by him/her at the time of personal registration, however the updating of income upwards or downwards
must be made upon request from an attendant and a descriptive explanation of the reason that led to this request. Such a business model restriction is thus implemented
due to the fact that the financial institution in question maintains a policy of good financial management practices and accurate decision selections through data science
and artificial intelligence algorithms, for example, a customer with a savings account that requests an income update downwards and presented unemployment as a reason, 
may be granted credit release with higher limits and more beneficial interest income. The bank also charges interest on the amount of capital present in the account 
(of any type), for natural customers, the institution charges the equivalent of 0.02% of their public health expenses, based on information and records. For legal clients,
the institution charges the equivalent of 0.05% if the legal entity has fewer than ten employees and 0.1% if it has ten or more employees.
